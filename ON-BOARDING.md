# ON-BOARDING

Create a droplet with Docker on Digital Ocean

Login to your VPS via SSH
```
ssh root@999.999.99.999
```

Create first ssh key with ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sztadii@gmail.com‚Äù

It will generate `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`

Copy your public key with
```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
or
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Add your already copied key from VPS for Github
https://github.com/settings/ssh/new

Go to droplet via SSH and clone the repo in a correct folder by
```
git clone https://github.com/sztadii/shop.git
```

Create keys specific for your Github CI machine
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sztadii@gmail.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
```

Then copy the public key to the clipboard
```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github.pub
```

And save it on your VPS in authorized_keys file
```
pbpaste > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
if pbpaste will be not available then
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_circleci.pub
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

PS. When you want to add more key each of them needs to be in a separate line

Then add the private key to Github 
https://github.com/sztadii/proxy/settings/secrets

Name it for example GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY

Then create the config file in correct folder and reuse GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY

Please take a look on below `.github/workflows/main.yml` example
